# ✅ Functional Test (FCT) Fixture

A **Functional Test Fixture** is a specialized mechanical and electrical setup used to verify the functional performance of a PCB or assembled electronic product by simulating real-world operating conditions.

---

## 📦 Description

The **Functional Test (FCT) Fixture** is used after PCB assembly to check whether the board or device works as intended. It connects the board to external test equipment (e.g., power supplies, signal generators, communication ports, etc.) and validates output responses, logic behavior, or complete system operation.

## 🧠 Why Is It Required?

- 🧪 To **verify actual functional performance** of the circuit, not just physical assembly
- ⚙️ To **simulate real-world use cases**, such as powering up, data transmission, or analog/digital input/output
- 🚨 To **identify latent defects** that visual or in-circuit tests cannot detect
- 📉 To reduce the chance of **field failure or customer complaints**

## 🧪 Impact on Testing Process

| Area              | Impact                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ✔️ Quality Control  | High — detects real functional defects                  |
| 🔌 Debugging        | Enables live testing and diagnosis                      |
| 💯 Reliability      | Improves customer satisfaction with fully tested boards |
| 🔁 Feedback Loop    | Allows design/assembly feedback before final release    |

## 🧰 Types

- **Manual FCT Fixtures**
  - Basic bed-of-nails or connector-based setup operated manually
  - Ideal for low to mid-volume testing

- **Semi-Automated FCT Fixtures**
  - Operator places DUT (Device Under Test) and initiates test sequence
  - Includes controlled power, relays, and status indicators

- **Fully Automated FCT Stations**
  - Integrated with test software, robotic handlers, barcode scanners
  - Used in high-volume production environments

- **Customized FCT Jigs**
  - Tailored for specific products with unique mechanical/electrical connectors

## ✅ How to Decide If FCT Fixture Is Needed

Use an FCT fixture when:

- The product has **power-on functionality**
- It has **active components** (e.g., MCUs, ICs, sensors, wireless modules)
- You must verify **firmware, communication, or I/O behavior**
- The application is **safety-critical** (medical, automotive, industrial)
- You need **pre-shipment assurance** of full functional working

Not required if:

- The board is **passive-only**
- Other tests (e.g., ICT, AOI, flying probe) cover all functional cases
- **Prototyping stage** or very low-volume hand assembly

---

## 🎁 Benefits

- ✔️ Confirms product works under real-world conditions
- ✔️ Reduces field failures and returns
- ✔️ Speeds up debugging and validation
- ✔️ Enhances brand reliability and compliance
- ✔️ Critical for certifications (UL, CE, EMC, etc.)

## 💰 Cost (Not Included)

Costs depend on:
- Custom connectors, sensors, or loads
- Automation level
- Software integration
- Reusability across models or product lines
