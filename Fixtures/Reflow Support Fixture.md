## 🔳 Reflow Support Fixture

### 🧩 Type:
- Thermal Process Support Fixture for Reflow Oven

---

### 📝 Description:
The **Reflow Support Fixture** is a mechanical frame or jig designed to support PCBs during the reflow soldering process. It prevents board sagging or warping under high temperatures and maintains component placement accuracy throughout the reflow profile.

---

### 🎯 Why It’s Required:
- To avoid **PCB bowing** or **warping** due to heat
- To protect **bottom-side components** from being crushed on conveyor belts
- To support **non-standard PCB shapes**, thin boards, or panels with cutouts
- For **double-sided reflow** and boards with heavy components

---

### 💥 Impact on Process:
- Prevents solder joint failure caused by **component misalignment**
- Enhances **thermal stability** during ramp, soak, and peak zones
- Reduces **defects** like tombstoning, misalignment, and shifting
- Ensures **reflow profile consistency** across all assemblies

---

### ✅ Benefits:
- 🔧 Mechanical support throughout oven travel
- 🛡️ Protection for sensitive components and solder joints
- 📏 Maintains coplanarity and flatness
- ♻️ Reusable for same panel layout
- 🔁 Improves reliability and repeatability in high-mix production

### 💰 Cost:
| Type                        | Estimated Cost (USD) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Standard Support Fixture     | $100 – $250          |
| Custom Machined Fixture      | $300 – $600+         |
| Adjustable Universal Fixture | $400 – $1000+        |

> 💡 *Cost varies based on board size, cutout complexity, materials (aluminum, stainless steel), and fixture design (spring-loaded, clamp-based, etc.).*
