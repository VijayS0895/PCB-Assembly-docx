## 🔲 Solder Printing Fixture

### 🧩 Type:
- Mechanical Support Fixture for SMT Process

---

### 📝 Description:
The solder printing fixture is a precision-made support plate or jig used to securely hold PCBs during the stencil printing process. It ensures flatness and proper alignment for accurate solder paste application using a stencil printer.

---

### 🎯 Why It’s Required:
- To prevent PCB **warpage or flexing** during stencil printing
- To **ensure alignment** between stencil apertures and PCB pads
- To **support double-sided boards** with bottom-side components
- To enable **repeatable high-precision printing** in automated lines

---

### 💥 Impact on Process:
- Reduces stencil misalignment
- Minimizes printing defects like **bridging**, **smearing**, or **insufficient paste**
- Prevents damage to **fine-pitch** or **flexible boards**
- Improves **solder joint reliability** from the start of the process

---

### ✅ Benefits:
- 📈 Increased first-pass yield (FPY)
- 🛠️ Improved print quality and solder deposit consistency
- 🧘 Fewer touch-ups and rework
- 🧊 Stabilizes thin, small, or oddly-shaped PCBs
- 🔁 Enhances repeatability in high-volume SMT production

### 💰 Cost:
| Type                | Estimated Cost (USD) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Standard Fixture     | $50 – $150           |
| Custom Machined Jig  | $200 – $500+         |
| Vacuum-based Fixture | $300 – $800+         |

> 💡 *Cost depends on complexity, material, number of cutouts, and customization.*
