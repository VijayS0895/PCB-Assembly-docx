# 🌊 Wave Fixture (Wave Soldering Pallet)

A **Wave Fixture**, also called a **Wave Soldering Pallet**, is a high-temperature, precision-machined support structure used during the **wave soldering** process to hold and protect PCB assemblies. It ensures proper alignment, supports the board, and provides masking for non-solderable areas.

---

## 🧾 Purpose

- 🔒 **Securely holds** the PCB during wave soldering
- 🛡️ **Protects SMT components** and heat-sensitive areas
- 🪛 **Exposes only solderable pins and pads**
- ⚙️ Enables **repeatable and automated** soldering for complex PCB layouts

## 📌 Key Features

| Feature                    | Details |
|----------------------------|---------|
| High Temp Material         | Typically made of Durostone, Durapol, or Glass Epoxy |
| Custom Cutouts             | Precise openings for through-hole components |
| SMT Protection             | Blocks solder contact for bottom-side SMT parts |
| ESD-Safe                   | Prevents electrostatic damage |
| Conveyor Compatible        | Designed for automated line integration |
| Reusable                   | Withstands multiple production runs |

---

## 🔍 When to Use

- ✅ PCB has both **through-hole and SMT** components
- ✅ Boards are **thin or flexible**, and risk warping
- ✅ High-volume **repeatable production** is needed
- ✅ **Lead-free soldering** requires higher thermal resistance
- ✅ Reduces the need for **manual taping/masking**
