# 🌊 Wave Solder Pallet

A **Wave Solder Pallet** is a precision-machined, reusable fixture used during the **wave soldering** process to securely hold PCBs, protect sensitive components, and ensure consistent soldering quality. It allows selective exposure of solderable areas while shielding the rest of the board from direct molten solder contact.

---

## 📦 Description

Wave soldering is commonly used for **through-hole PCB assembly**, where the bottom of the board is passed over a wave of molten solder. A **wave solder pallet** is typically made from high-temperature, anti-static materials like **Durostone** or **composite fiberglass**, shaped to:

- Hold the PCB in place
- Mask SMT (surface-mount) components
- Create apertures only for solderable leads
- Prevent warpage and misalignment during wave exposure

---

## 🧠 Why Is It Required?

- 🚫 **Protects SMT components** on the bottom side of the PCB from molten solder
- 📏 **Enforces precise alignment** of through-hole leads with solder wave
- 🔥 **Resists high temperatures** (up to 300°C) without degradation
- 🔁 Allows **reusability**, reducing cost in high-volume production
- ✅ Enables **mixed-technology PCBs** (SMT + through-hole) to be soldered in one process

## 🧰 Key Functions

| Function                 | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Component Protection** | Shields heat-sensitive or SMT components from solder contact |
| **Selective Soldering**  | Exposes only required areas for soldering through custom cutouts |
| **Board Support**        | Prevents sagging or warping of large/thin boards during wave solder |
| **Fiducial & Tooling**   | Integrates features for pick-and-place, alignment, and conveyor systems |

## 🏭 Materials Used

- **Durostone** (commonly preferred)
- Glass-reinforced epoxy composites
- Machinable ceramic composites
- ESD-safe and lead-free compatible materials

## ✅ When to Use a Wave Solder Pallet

Use wave solder pallets when:

- PCB has **bottom-side SMT components**
- You require **selective soldering** of through-hole components
- The board is **large, thin, or flexible**
- Consistent **thermal protection** is needed across production runs
- You want to **increase throughput** with less manual masking

---

## ⚙️ Design Considerations

- 🔳 **Cutout apertures** should be accurately aligned with through-hole pins
- 🔩 Include **hold-down clamps or locks** for board security
- 🧊 Must handle **thermal cycling** without cracking or warping
- 🔄 Reusability must be optimized for **multiple production runs**
- 📏 Add **guide pins and fiducials** for conveyor and robotic alignment

---

## 🎯 Benefits

- ✔️ Improved **solder quality and consistency**
- ✔️ Reduced **thermal stress** on sensitive components
- ✔️ Eliminates need for **manual taping or masking**
- ✔️ Faster **setup and teardown** in the wave solder line
- ✔️ Supports **lead-free soldering** environments
