# 🏷️ Labelling in PCB Assembly (PCBA)

**Labelling** refers to the process of marking printed circuit boards (PCBs) with critical information for identification, traceability, and process control throughout manufacturing and product lifecycle.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Labelling

- Enable **traceability** of components, lots, revisions, and processes
- Aid in **inventory control** and **material handling**
- Facilitate **quality inspection** and **customer requirements**
- Support **compliance** with industry standards (e.g., ISO, IPC, RoHS)

## 🆔 Common Types of Labels

| Label Type         | Description & Use Case                                   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Barcode**        | Machine-readable for scanning and tracking               |
| **2D Data Matrix** | Compact, holds large data; commonly used for traceability|
| **Serial Number**  | Unique identification for each board                     |
| **Revision Code**  | Indicates PCB or BOM revision level                      |
| **Date Code**      | Manufacturing date tracking                              |
| **Lot/Batch Code** | Links board to specific production batch                 |
| **RoHS Label**     | Indicates lead-free compliance                           |
| **UL/CE Marking**  | Safety and regulatory labeling                           |

## 🖨️ Labelling Methods

| Method            | Description                             | Use Case                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Silkscreen**    | Printed directly on PCB during fab       | Static info (part no., version) |
| **Sticker/Label** | Adhesive paper/polyester labels          | Barcodes, serials, compliance   |
| **Laser Marking** | Non-contact, permanent marking           | High-reliability applications   |
| **Inkjet Printing**| High-speed, non-contact print            | Automated assembly lines        |

## 📌 Placement Guidelines

- Should not cover test pads, vias, or components
- Must withstand **reflow soldering** temperatures
- Should be **easily accessible** for scanning/inspection
- Avoid obstructing fiducials or optical alignment marks

---

## 📋 Industry Standards

- **IPC-2581**: For data exchange including labeling info
- **MIL-STD-130**: Labeling for military and aerospace
- **ISO 9001**: Traceability and quality documentation
- **RoHS/WEEE**: Compliance marking requirements

---

## 🔧 Best Practices

- Use **durable**, high-temperature resistant labels
- Ensure **readability** post-soldering/reflow
- Implement **label verification** in production lines
- Maintain a **label registry** for serial/lot tracking

---

## ✅ Summary

Labelling is a vital part of PCBA for:
- Product traceability
- Quality control
- Compliance
- Logistics

Proper labeling improves efficiency and reduces errors across the supply chain.
