# ⚠️ Leaded Solder Types in PCBA

Leaded solders have been widely used in the electronics industry due to their excellent electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. However, due to environmental and health concerns, they are **restricted under RoHS** regulations in many countries.

## 🧪 Common Leaded Solder Types

| 🔬 Composition         | 🧾 Description                        | 🌡️ Melting Point |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Sn63Pb37**           | 63% Tin, 37% Lead (eutectic alloy)   | 183°C            |
| **Sn60Pb40**           | 60% Tin, 40% Lead                    | 183–190°C        |
| **Sn62Pb36Ag2**        | Tin, Lead, Silver alloy (for fine pitch) | 179°C         |

## 🛠️ Characteristics of Leaded Solder

- 🔥 **Lower melting point** (eutectic point at 183°C for Sn63Pb37)
- 🌡️ **Wider process window**, easier for reflow and wave soldering
- 🧲 **Good wetting properties**
- 🔁 **Easier to rework** and repair
- ⛔ **Contains lead**, which is toxic and regulated

## ✅ When and Why It’s Used

| 📌 Use Case                | 📝 Notes                                                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Military and Aerospace**| Often exempt from RoHS due to reliability and performance demands    |
| **Medical Devices**       | Where RoHS exemptions apply                                          |
| **Legacy Equipment**      | For repair and backward compatibility                                |
| **High-Reliability Needs**| Proven mechanical strength over years                                |

## ❌ Environmental and Health Considerations

- ☣️ **Toxicity**: Lead is harmful to human health and the environment
- 🧪 **Contamination Risk**: Leaded and lead-free lines must be separated in manufacturing
- 📜 **RoHS Restriction**: Banned in consumer electronics in many jurisdictions

## 🧪 Comparison: Leaded vs Lead-Free

| Feature                | Leaded (Sn63Pb37) | Lead-Free (SAC305)  |
|------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Melting Point          | 183°C            | ~217–219°C          |
| Wetting                | Excellent        | Moderate            |
| Joint Appearance       | Shiny            | Matte/Dull          |
| Toxicity               | High (Pb)        | Low (Pb-free)       |
| RoHS Compliance        | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes              |
| Cost                   | Lower            | Higher              |
