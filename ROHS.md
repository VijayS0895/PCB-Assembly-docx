# ♻️ RoHS-Compliant Solder Types

RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) restricts the use of certain hazardous materials, including lead (Pb), in electronic assemblies. Therefore, traditional lead-based solder (Sn63Pb37) is replaced with **lead-free solder** types.

## 🧪 Common RoHS-Compliant Solder Types

| 🔬 Composition        | 🧾 Description                                        | 🌡️ Melting Point |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **SAC305**           | Tin (96.5%), Silver (3.0%), Copper (0.5%)            | ~217–219°C       |
| **SAC405**           | Tin (95.5%), Silver (4.0%), Copper (0.5%)            | ~217–220°C       |
| **Sn100C**           | Tin (99.25%), Copper (0.7%), Cobalt/Nickel (0.05%)   | ~227°C           |
| **SnCuNi**           | Tin + Copper + Nickel (no silver, cost-effective)    | ~227°C           |
| **SACX0307**         | Tin (99%), Silver (0.3%), Copper (0.7%)              | ~217–228°C       |

## ✅ Why RoHS-Compliant Solders Are Required

- 🚫 **Lead-Free Regulation**: Mandatory for products sold in RoHS-regulated regions (e.g., EU).
- 🌍 **Environmental Compliance**: Reduces hazardous waste and improves recyclability.
- 👷 **Worker Safety**: Minimizes exposure to toxic substances during manufacturing.

## 🧪 How to Choose RoHS Solder

| 📌 Criteria                  | 📝 Considerations                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Component Sensitivity**   | Use lower-temp SAC alloys for heat-sensitive parts                             |
| **Thermal Profile**         | Ensure reflow oven is optimized for higher lead-free temperatures (~240–250°C) |
| **Cost vs. Performance**    | SAC305 is standard but expensive; SnCuNi is cheaper alternative                |
| **Joint Reliability**       | Silver improves wetting and mechanical strength, but increases cost            |

## 🔧 Notes

- RoHS-compliant solders **require different fluxes** and **reflow profiles**.
- PCB finishes should be compatible with lead-free solder (e.g., ENIG, OSP).
- **Rework temperatures** for RoHS solder joints are higher than leaded.
