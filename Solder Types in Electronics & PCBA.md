# 🔩 Solder Types in Electronics & PCBA

Solder is a fusible metal alloy used to create a **permanent bond between metal workpieces**, commonly used in **PCB Assembly (PCBA)** to connect components to the board.

## 🧪 1. Classification by Composition

### 🧷 A. **Lead-Based Solder (Sn-Pb)**

| Type | Composition | Melting Point | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Sn63/Pb37** | 63% Tin / 37% Lead | ~183°C | Eutectic alloy. Most popular traditional alloy. |
| **Sn60/Pb40** | 60% Tin / 40% Lead | ~183–190°C | Slightly higher melting point, good wetting. |

> ⚠️ **Health & Environmental Risk** — Banned/restricted in many regions (RoHS compliance).

### 🧷 B. **Lead-Free Solder**

| Alloy | Composition | Melting Point | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **SAC305** | 96.5% Sn / 3.0% Ag / 0.5% Cu | ~217°C | Most common lead-free solder. RoHS compliant. |
| **SAC405** | 95.5% Sn / 4.0% Ag / 0.5% Cu | ~217–219°C | Better mechanical properties, costlier. |
| **Sn100C** | Sn / Cu / Ni / Ge | ~227°C | Low cost, good wetting, less dross formation. |
| **SnBi (Tin-Bismuth)** | Tin / Bismuth | ~138°C | For low-temp applications. Brittle. |
| **SnAg (Tin-Silver)** | Tin / Silver | ~221°C | Expensive, used in high-reliability applications. |

## 🧪 2. Classification by Form

| Form | Description | Usage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Solder Wire** | Wire with or without flux core | Hand soldering |
| **Solder Paste** | Powdered alloy + flux | SMT reflow process |
| **Solder Bar** | Solid bar | Wave soldering or dip soldering |
| **Preforms** | Custom-shaped solder (e.g., washers, frames) | High-precision soldering |

---

## 💡 3. Flux Core in Solder Wire

Flux is a chemical agent that removes oxides and improves solderability.

| Type | Flux Type | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Rosin Core** | Natural rosin | Traditional, used in electronics. Can be cleaned or left as-is. |
| **No-Clean** | Synthetic resin | Leaves minimal residue. Cleaning usually not required. |
| **Water-Soluble** | Organic acid-based | Must be cleaned thoroughly after soldering. |

## ⚙️ 4. Selection Criteria

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| 🔋 **Electrical Performance** | Low-resistance, no residue |
| ♻️ **RoHS Compliance** | Required in Europe and many regions |
| 🌡️ **Operating Temperature** | Match melting point to component sensitivity |
| 🧱 **Mechanical Strength** | SAC series > SnBi |
| 🧼 **Cleaning Requirements** | No-clean vs water-soluble flux |
| 💰 **Cost** | Lead-free solders are usually more expensive |

## 🔍 Common Standards

- **J-STD-006** – Solder alloy specifications
- **RoHS Directive** – Restriction of hazardous substances
- **IPC-SM-840** – Qualification of solder masks

## 📌 Summary Table

| Type       | Lead Status | Common Use |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Sn63/Pb37  | Leaded       | Traditional electronics (non-RoHS) |
| SAC305     | Lead-Free    | General RoHS-compliant assemblies |
| Sn100C     | Lead-Free    | Wave soldering, cost-effective |
| SnBi       | Lead-Free    | Low-temp boards |
| Solder Paste | Any       | SMT placement and reflow |
