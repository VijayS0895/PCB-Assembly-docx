# 🛠️ IPC Class 2 Assembly – Dedicated Service Electronic Products

🔧 **Class 2** assemblies are built for **continued performance and extended life**, where **reliability is important**, but not mission-critical. Some cosmetic imperfections are allowed, but must not affect performance.

---

## 📌 Definition (per IPC-A-610 & J-STD-001)

> **Class 2 – Dedicated Service Electronic Products**: Devices where extended performance and **reliability are required**, but uninterrupted service is **not critical**. Appearance is **not essential**, but **functional performance** and **stability** are.

---

## 🧩 Typical Class 2 Products

- 🚗 Automotive electronics  
- 🏭 Industrial controls and instrumentation  
- 📺 Consumer-grade audio/video equipment  
- 🖨️ Office equipment and appliances  
- 🔧 Home automation systems  
- ⏱️ Timers, sensors, and relays

## 📊 Key Characteristics

| ✅ Criteria               | Class 2 Description |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 📦 Functionality         | Reliable, long-term performance |
| 🧼 Cosmetic Finish       | Not critical, but controlled |
| 🧲 Solder Joint Quality  | Must meet defined standards (good wetting, fillet) |
| 🔍 Visual Defects        | Limited; must not impair function |
| 🧪 Environmental Exposure | Moderate (non-critical environments) |
| 🔧 Maintenance Needs     | Moderate lifecycle, some serviceability |
| 📉 Lifespan Expectation  | Mid-to-long-term usage |

---

## ❌ What’s Acceptable in Class 2?

- Minor solder irregularities **if fully functional**
- Slight flux residues (if non-corrosive and within limits)
- Slightly uneven solder joints **with full coverage**

---

## 🔬 Soldering Requirements

- 🧪 Must meet full **J-STD-001 Class 2 solder quality**
- 🧲 Includes **correct fillet height**, **wetting angle**, and **barrel fill**
- ❌ No cracks, voids, bridging, or exposed copper

## 📦 Summary

🛠️ **Class 2 = Reliable + Durable + Cost-Effective**  
Designed for **non-critical yet important applications** where reliability, **service life**, and **performance stability** are needed — but full military-grade controls are not necessary.

---

💡 *Tip: Use **Class 2** when building for **industry, automotive, or commercial electronics**, where performance matters but total failure is tolerable with maintenance.*
