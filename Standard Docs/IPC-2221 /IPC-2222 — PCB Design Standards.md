## 🧠 IPC-2221: Key Design Guidelines

### 📏 Conductor Width & Spacing
- Based on **current carrying capacity** and **voltage levels**
- Follows IPC-2152 for **thermal management calculations**

### 🕳️ Via & Hole Design
- **Plating thickness**, **aspect ratio**, and **clearance**
- Blind/buried via definitions and stack-up rules

### 🧯 Creepage & Clearance
- Insulation design for **high-voltage circuits**
- Refers to **IPC-9592** and **UL standards**

## 🧠 IPC-2222: Rigid PCB Design Highlights

- 📦 Rigid board **materials**, **layer stackups**, and **build-up techniques**
- 🧲 **Impedance control** for high-speed designs
- 🔩 Hole tolerances, **mechanical constraints**, and **mounting holes**
- 🔬 **Microvias** and **HDI** support for complex designs

## ⚙️ Board Classes (per IPC-6011)

| Class | Use Case | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | General Electronic Products | Low cost, low reliability |
| 2️⃣ | Dedicated Service | Industrial/Consumer |
| 3️⃣ | High Reliability | Aerospace, military, medical |

## ✅ Summary

🧩 IPC-2221/2222 provide the **foundation for designing professional-grade PCBs**, from trace spacing and layer stackups to vias and component footprints.

🧪 Use them early in the design process to avoid:
- ❌ Manufacturing delays  
- ❌ Signal integrity issues  
- ❌ Costly redesigns
