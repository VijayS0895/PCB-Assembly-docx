## 🔍 Visual Acceptance Criteria

| 🔧 Feature | ✅ Acceptable | ❌ Reject |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Solder Joints | Smooth, shiny, concave fillet | Dull, cracked, insufficient fill |
| Component Placement | Correct orientation and alignment | Skewed, tombstoned, misaligned |
| Lead Protrusion | Within defined range | Too short or excessive |
| SMT Fillets | Proper wetting and fillet size | Insufficient wetting, solder balling |
| Cleaning | Free of residues | Flux, fingerprints, or other contamination |

## 🔧 Common Solder Joint Types

- 🔩 **Through-Hole**: barrel fill, lead protrusion, wetting angle
- 🧱 **Chip Component**: symmetric solder joints
- 🦵 **Gull-Wing**: wrap around the foot
- 🪛 **J-Lead**: fillet forms at toe only
- 📦 **BTCs / QFNs**: voiding and wetting control

---

## 📏 Key Requirements

- 📐 Minimum lead protrusion based on hole diameter
- 💧 Cleanliness validated via ionic testing
- 🌡️ Heat damage is not allowed on components or PCB
- 🎨 Markings must be clear, legible, and durable
- 🧴 Coating must be even and bubble-free

---

## 🛡️ Handling & ESD Requirements

- 👷 Use of ESD wrist straps and safe storage
- 📦 Proper packaging to prevent mechanical damage
- 🧤 No bare hand contact with solderable areas
